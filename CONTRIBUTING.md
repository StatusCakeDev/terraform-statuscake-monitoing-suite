# How To Contribute

Contributions are welcome as we strive to make this module as useful as possible
for everyone. However time is not always on our side, and changes may not be
reviewed or merged in a timely manner.

If this module is found to be missing in functionality, please open an issue
describing the proposed change - discussing changes ahead of time reduces
friction within pull requests.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (1.0+)
- [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) (optional)

## Installation
